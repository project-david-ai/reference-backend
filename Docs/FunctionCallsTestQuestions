User: Hi Q, I'm interested in exploring some economic data for the UK. Can you tell me what datasets are available from the Office for National Statistics related to the economy or business?

Assistant: To get information about available datasets from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), I will use the getOnsDataSets function.

{
  "name": "getOnsDataSets",
  "arguments": {
    "limit": 5,
    "offset": 0
  }
}

User: Great, thanks for the list of datasets! I'm particularly interested in the "UK Business: Activity, Size and Location" dataset. Can you provide more details about what information is included in that dataset?

Assistant: To get more information about the "UK Business: Activity, Size and Location" dataset, I will use the getOnsDataSets function again with a limit of 1 and search for the specific dataset ID.

{
  "name": "getOnsDataSets",
  "arguments": {
    "limit": 1,
    "offset": 0,
    "datasetId": "uk-business-by-enterprises-and-local-units"
  }
}

User: Thank you for the detailed information about the "UK Business: Activity, Size and Location" dataset. Can you now fetch the actual data for the latest available year and provide a summary of the key insights or trends you observe in the data?

Assistant: To fetch the latest data for the "UK Business: Activity, Size and Location" dataset and provide a summary, I will use a new function called getOnsDatasetData.

{
  "name": "getOnsDatasetData",
  "arguments": {
    "datasetId": "uk-business-by-enterprises-and-local-units",
    "edition": "2022",
    "version": "1"
  }
}
